# penny-arcade-filter-threads
Easy to use script that allows you to filter out threads with whatever titles you put.

For use with Tampermonkey (for chrome) or Greasemonkey (for Firefox).

# To Install
With Tampermonkey click the icon in your browser and go to "Create a New Script..." then copy/paste everything from the .js file into there and save it. When you go back to Penny-Arcade (refresh if you haven't) you should see a new X next to each thread. When you click it, the thread will immediately be hidden. Every place that thread shows up will be hidden.

To unhide a thread scroll to the very end and click on the "View Filters" button and then click the red X to remove the filter.
